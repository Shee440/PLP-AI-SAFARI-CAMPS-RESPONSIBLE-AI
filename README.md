# 🕵️‍♀️ AI Detective Blog – Investigating Responsible AI

## 📘 Overview

This blog post explores the role of a "Responsible AI Inspector" by analyzing two real-world AI use cases. The goal is to describe what the AI is doing, identify ethical concerns (like bias or lack of transparency), and suggest responsible ways to improve it.



## 🧠 Cases Investigated

### 1. 🤖 Hiring Bot Bias  
A company uses AI to screen job applications, but it unfairly rejects female candidates with career gaps.

- **Issue:** Gender bias, lack of accountability  
- **Fix:** Retrain with diverse, inclusive data and include human review steps

### 2. 🎓 AI Exam Proctoring  
An AI system flags students as cheaters based on eye movement, disproportionately affecting neurodivergent students.

- **Issue:** Unfair targeting, privacy concerns  
- **Fix:** Use AI to assist, not automate, with human moderation and inclusive design


## ✍️ Blog Style  
Written in a fun, clear tone as if from a digital detective uncovering "suspicious" AI behavior — to make the topic accessible and engaging for readers.
